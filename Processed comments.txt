[495] wheatonmahoneyphotography: God damn that’s a view!
[496] shanseyfii: ❄⭐❄
[497] melanie_wienstroer: 
[498] laricciolidoro: Where?
[499] decimoluis: Greetings from Buenos Aires- Argentina
[500] ya_n1: 
[1] toledoindoorgarden: I’ve had rougher landings on spirit
[2] boris_nbg21: Zero anticipation by the emergency crew
[3] originalsjiujitsuacademy: That was fkn beautiful bravo to the pilot
[4] rich_19852012: Well, the pilots of the JeJu Air, successfully landed a belly landing, the problem was a short runway with reinforced concrete wall. Why isn’t ts being discussed? Poor airport design IMO.
[5] columbiapikemazza: Good pilot still
[6] eyeyron_43: That concrete wall killed those people
[7] enjoyhenley: Where are the fire trucks?
[8] premiumtoppers: Pilot deserves a raise....he saved the plane and lives with s experience. Else, insurance company would have been in hot financial soup!
[9] _treyvont: Where are the emergency services?!!!!
[10] mac.batterson: So where are the airport emergency services
[11] dalejohnson_: Why aren’t the rescue vecles already there?
[12] galaxies: Thank heavens it wasnt a Bowing
[13] karasenaar48: Hot damg who landed that a Skywalker!
[14] fuzzyjapan: The pilot does ts with an airplane and everybody claps. I do ts with a shopping cart in the parking lot and everyone calls the police. It's not fair.
[15] brando_fitt: love how everyone just ran away no recording or anytng
[16] mrdee_aas: Why not have an emergency runway filled with sand for incidents like ts? Every airport should have ts facility to be used when necessary. There should be precautions to be adopted. More likely to happen cos these aircraft are macnes and macnes fails.
[17] birdsongz: Glad ts is first video I watched after logging on into the plane WiFi.
[18] lconnorrn: And notice nobody with cell phones out or carrying luggage.  Get out and be safe.
[19] askthepilot: The "expertise" of the wannabe pilots in these comments is equally frustrating and larious.  What is it about aviation that makes everyone tnk they're an expert?  Do these same people watch reels of medical procedures and critique the surgeons?
[20] laspintasdepinto: Give that Pilot a raise
[21] camelzken: Fantastic job.
[22] juliencharlierr: @antoinebrct
[23] advanced_vision_security: Lucky the fire crew were there.
[24] comeaudan: Why wasn’t there a giant impenetrable wall to stop them?
[25] plipereis7: That is one hell of a pilot
[26] woodworker_1316: Pilot deserves a medal.
[27] spkouwenhoven: Any landing that you walk away from is a good landing… Chuck Yeager.
[28] _daniel.morris: and my student still can’t land on centerline
[29] monariani: They’re running away out of shame
[30] ikelaiho: In my humble opinion the belly landing wasn't really the issue, it was the stupid concrete barrier at the end of the runway that ended all those lives. Yes the plane might have gone into the bushes or into the river but not a concrete barrier.
[31] spacerhodes: Ts video didn’t make it look difficult
[32] brian_hword: That’s Vegas always to be known as McCarran airport not stupid Harry Reid
[33] bigswitch_: 
[34] sefi_am: 
[35] magasparty: 
[36] flyboy_mide: I’m sure the pilot communicated the nature of emergency…where the fuck was the fire extinguisng truck….
[37] barragan_photography: My favorite part of ts kind of  emergency responses is the paramedics and firefighters driving at a gh speed, rather than waiting for the aircraft at the end of the runway to mitigate the fire and assist passengers.
[38] house_of_ross: 25 years later, I wonder where these people are now and how they would recount ts story.
[39] telamormusic: Luckily, no concrete barricade to smash into.
[40] jvaca19: @i_picazo
[41] citizenbb_: What is the likelihood that both flaps and gear would fail simultaneously?
[42] angelic_og: No concrete barrier?? How else is a plane supposed to land if it’s not into a wall??
[43] nicholasccarley: They needed to build a concrete wall across the runway to stop the plane faster
[44] mulangira31: In South Korea they put a concrete barrier to end the runway and it doesn’t end well.
[45] ofunbile25: Volvieron a nacer
[46] tyler_limoges: I’ve had rougher landings on a Spirit flight
[47] robthebuilder5: smooth landing
[48] bizzybrad1: Hawkers were built to fly the Queen. They all have a reinforced underbelly for that purpose
[49] dionphotography: How was the E crew not rolling down that runway ready
[50] marcbrierley: Great job by the fire department there.
[51] guillermocalamardo: To demostrate how difficult it can be? As if someone could tnk it would be easy. Well, tnking about it, thete are people that believe they can beat a grizzly...
[52] lookphoto.studio: In Germany it would land on the foam covered runway, surrounded by fire squads! Where the hell was ts?
[53] toniolonz: Fire brigade ?  All watcng sports on TV and having a beer I guess.
[54] deralex2985: Why doesn’t he land earlier?
[55] mugsybn1999: Firefighters on break???
[56] txchris22: To ts wondering where the emergency ground crews are in the video, I see at least three trucks stationed at various lengths along the runway. Ts small craft went further than anticipated based on the caption and it’s a heavy truck trying to catch up to a belly landing plane on a 2+ mile runway. Plus the video ends pretty shortly after landing and occupants evacuate. Wide angle shot probably would show the emergency ground crews closing in.
[57] earth2bear: Absolutely nailed that landing.
[58] feminineattractions: They weren’t running fast enough for me
[59] sam_u2smoove: First tngs first, my boy buttered that landing but why were they not immediately bombarded with emergency services ??
[60] creative_notions: What suppressed the fire under the wings at the end?
[61] artyom.snt: the last flash was show-off :)
[62] f.martinsc: Where is the foam?!
[63] cynsanti17: When we had experienced pilots.
[64] ronerider: there is no wall barrier at the end of the runway
[65] _kuttakutta: I ain’t NEVER seen ppl get off a plane so damn fast in my life!
[66] silverstackin81: Glad to see the emergency crew out there waiting...
[67] poweredgeman: Wing tank fire suppression?
[68] spottedelpaso: “Tada!” ahh sparks at the end
[69] pljp08: Would a water landing not be less risky?
[70] seramrajeshwaran: I always wonder why firefighters don't use water on the runway to avoid friction. Why why why???
[71] marc_bales: That was impressive
[72] flyingpeanutz: They should’ve used the parashute. That’s why I don’t trust these small planes. They don’t have professional pilots flying them
[73] victor_o_nakamura: Not hard. Done it in war thunder
[74] kinetic_carving: Honest question. Why won’t a leveled grass area next to the runway help prevent a potential fire?
[75] harrisonrace: Looks a lot easier to do when you don’t have a concrete wall at the end of the run way.
[76] not_the_real_slick_rick: Ts lear came in slow....that Korean seemed overspeed no flaps no spoilers like the pilots panicked and forgot all their training.....not saying I'd do better......just seems a bad situation was made even worse.....
[77] airstarrr111: They so lucky the flames went out
[78] prasilk: why not slide in grass/mud where risk of fire is reduced.
[79] danny.spang: No concrete wall to pancake the plane like in South Korea
[80] mrxpel: Maybe a weird question, but why wouldn’t you try to land on the grass next to the strip? Less chance of a fire right?
[81] chrishartttt: Happy girlmore accomplished that feat no more then a hour ago
[82] ak_sikes: Not bad, but wouldn’t you want to touch down on the end of the runway instead of midway
[83] marcovenustus: Is the plane totaled or can it still be fixed?
[84] the_repo_man_is_coming: Plus bailing out only sends ts possibly into a neighborhood verses a well practiced in simulator gear up landing such as you see here.
[85] larubialeclere: Impressive.
[86] delramsey: Pilot 10/10, fire crew?!!
[87] gangstacolin: Idk looked pretty easy
[88] shabbadunk.v: I dont see a concrete wall anywhere in ts video
[89] jordanredstar: Man pilot skills
[90] tredsft: Amazing bit of Flying!!!
[91] gabegabesvegas: Sorry but he made it look easy af! Incorrect title!
[92] asylum_customsuk: Surely diverting to grassed area and slightly increasing nose angle would be better or would I be wrong
[93] mattdogg53: Ts was a rare defect in the Hawk 600A. The next model, the Hawk 2A, did not have the same equipment issues
[94] danpies2022: Firefighters have coffee
[95] jamiepeoples061: They knew ts plane was coming where are all the emergency trucks and help
[96] ty91tp: Impressive
[97] johnmacphersonjr: 
[98] ronald_richard85: Happy Gilmore accomplished ts feat no more than an hour ago.
[99] notch8official: Happy gilmore accomplished ts fleet…no more than an hour ago
[100] wiemerochristine: Scary i hate to fly
[101] natedavies1776: Who told the trucks to set up halfway down the runway?
[102] kdanchorage: Is even more difficult trying to land nose down in a full dive.
[103] norbertjensen189: These planes need some kind of emergency parachute come on
[104] smokerise8: No foam???
[105] franknphotos: Ground Effect.
[106] dustingriffith87: Looked pretty easy to me
[107] zahed_felemban: I wonder when will aircraft companies make parachute pods at the aft or/and fore , just to save a few pennies worth of fuel maybe?
[108] babajnewz: So fire department can't be on standby at different point?
[109] josiahjosiahjosiah: Why don’t they make the whole plane out of the black box?!!!
[110] thebrowntruck69: Looks easy af.. slow down and bring nose down.
[111] sanjairamaswamy_reddi: Land in a Lake or river pilot
[112] papecno666: Wow what an experienced pilot you did a great job at least you got the people down safely more power to you you're a great pilot don't let no one tell you otherwise
[113] hawky.hay13: For you people talking about sand/water/mud landings, they would be WAY worse than ts. Friction is good but bad. Too much of it can cause the plane to break apart or flip.
[114] brewer.g: FIRE TRUCKS SHOULD OF BEEN TAILING IT .....WHERE IS THE FOAM ...HOSES .... EMERGENCY UNITS ...???
[115] cadusl4: firefighter on the coffee break
[116] medek_jakub: Respect ✊️
[117] ryan_lewicki_: The US making me not fly no more
[118] kunu_2006: Suprising there were no backup for fire , commendable job though .
[119] princessleiamightymite_threee: Terrible response time by the ground emergency crew!!
[120] the_new_edger: Had worst landings with a fullly functional plane
[121] joshsa_cr9: Gulfstream! Wow. Amazing
[122] abovedeckscharters: Surprised the fire engines weren’t following bend and quicker on the scene??
[123] oakie75: What about having an emergency parachute in the back for all planes?
[124] williamppe: Where in three he'll are the firetrucks, at the casino?
[125] sgmaxgs: Que cagazo el momento donde se incendia las alas
[126] michaeldesilvio: It's not difficult at all if you practice with a flight simulator.
[127] franc3s3: Ci sono dei Ryanair che atterrano peggio
[128] racinmonk003: Someone get those illegals!?!?!?!?
[129] rev2bluv: Nice job
[130] hjaernaan: Hydraulic failure?
[131] cmobbyn: On November 1, 2011, Captain Tadeusz Wrona became the first and, so far, the only pilot in the story of Chopin Airport to land without extended landing gear. By doing so, he saved the lives of 231 people on board the aircraft. And the best is that was boeing 767
[132] mylanblessup: He did a great job. The worst tng that could happen to you wle performing ts maneuver is the plane rolling over wch is also the more than likely result. He may have went in a big faster so that he can still keep that gher pressure under the wings to keep the plane from rolling over wle skidding up on the run way. So impressive
[133] btaylor_prod: So I assumed they landed with little to no fuel
[134] hoonfoto77: No firefighters?
[135] gideonbrownmusic: And that’s why you don’t have a concrete all at the end of a runway.
[136] gideonbrownmusic: Amazing pilot.
[137] bazzabazza54: Brilliant work from the pilot, all that training on show.
[138] louis_kelemen: 
[139] _lenyy.hru: I do that every time on war thunder, not that hard
[140] timo_van_den_brink: Average War Thunder landing
[141] luisperezmiranda: Why has the emergency trucks taken so long to reach the plane?!
[142] channing.mike: And the fire and rescue services were where??
[143] bettercallwolfy: Its not THAT hard
[144] plip_dickson: Notice a lack of a brick wall at the end of the strip
[145] joesignpro: Badass
[146] incredible_mcjolly: Was there no fire truck?
[147] kjmc427: Also well trained  competent pilot had alot to do with such landing! The more we let macnes control us the more we lose our functions  and touch and become incompetent!
[148] the_andrei_experience: Your aircraft will be repaired in 00:30
[149] evilminion909: Do planes that size not have thrust reverser?
[150] _daydreamingrealist_: How close is the fuel tank to the bottom of a plane like ts?
[151] jammyjohn: Crash report: "oopsie!"
[152] r15smr: Why are the fire trucks not there witn seconds?
[153] seemehow_: Run for the money... I mean your life.
[154] ricerob: Sully could have made it back to the airport.
[155] jptrick007: Pilot of the year
[156] dhruvdhamma: Ohh my god...... what a tragedy..
[157] captainkirkfilms: I’m tackling the pilot in joy when we get off the plane
[158] vittorio_vestiti: And just where are the fire trucks.. ridiculous !!!
[159] ethanhaning: 
[160] radicool52: I was afraid all that friction would ignite the remaining fuel, makes me wonder if there wasn't much fuel left in the tank
[161] dbk3r: The firetruck were waiting at the beginning of the runway at landing point cuz they are so smart
[162] thomasrglassburner: We don't foam runways anymore
[163] floyd.chambers: And fuel ⛽️ dump
[164] runningjock: No luggage!
Good job!
RUN!
[165] donnieavant: A few million dollars down the drain....yikes!
[166] underacrownofthorns: 
[167] wiest_travel: Pilot did amazing.
[168] clawson: Me when there’s eggs at Trader Joe’s.
[169] road2cat1: I wonder if it's possible to use some type of emergency chemicall/rubber solution  before landing just so it helps provide more grip and anti-fire protection wle gliding on the floor?
[170] nealgillivan: When pilots could fly and it was based on competency.
[171] mshybrid: 消防車が並走してないのヤバくない?
[172] totocoms: Drag- aerodynamics
[173] butchmeister80: He dragged it out surprised didn’t run out of runway
[174] mjf_405: poor plane :(
[175] moike.the.squid: "butter..."
[176] keith_63_: Very poor emergency planning
[177] aaroncapps5: Fire crews had a terrible response time
[178] jarret_in_boston: That's a f***ing hero, pro Pilot right there. Thank your pilots whenever exiting a flight. Come on people!
[179] dubbel2604: Excellent job by the pilots
[180] hexayed: I like the little flare up to finish the show
[181] jarret_in_boston: The fire was Aluminum and paint/vinyl melting.  The big huff at the end was hero pilot cutting the engine fuel pump system.
[182] neeraj_harimohan87: And still y there is no firefighters
[183] rudymienex: No foam???
[184] irelandthroughmylensandmore: Did firefighters turn up the next day or .....
[185] christophe1gerard: Ils mettent du temps à venir les pompiers !!!
[186] papafondo: I’d be absolutely p*ssing myself with fear trying to do ts. Do you dump fuel prior to ts so you don’t ignite it and glide in?
[187] marcjeboon: The pilot could have steered the aircraft into the grass for a quicker stop.
[188] kelvynjay1: The final fire spit was cool
[189] maddjag: And the fuel tank is in the rear of that aircraft
[190] realquick2981: Inside of ts; lemme just jump over water into a lake; or ocean.
[191] walbrant_helm: Why are these 25 year old videos suddenly showing up? It’s almos like someone wants to sow fear and distrust in the FAA.
[192] robertprahl: That didn’t look difficult at all. It was the same flair one would perform if the landing gear were deployed.
[193] dave.bernhardt1: He came awful fast it seems
[194] chrislicht_sbo: Emergency crew dropped the ball on ts one. wtf
[195] deathsconundrum: the pyro technics on the wings were cool.
[196] chaserodriguez__: Ts was trumps fault.
[197] cenyo100: Those sparks are from the pilot's balls of steel dragging on the runway
[198] qpaurh: Bro put down on s tibble tobbler
[199] turnip_wobbler: Wow well done Pilot. Very lucky
[200] bearded.wskey.connoisseur: Where’s the first responders?
[201] _doob___: Do they dump the fuel before attempting ts
[202] jaylestingi: All I know is that pilot is a boss
[203] danegolferkemp: I definitely wouldn’t want to be 1/4 mile up the runway before I sat it down.
[204] _steveymoon_: I can't imagine the state of the crew's underwear, once the plane came to a standstill!!!
[205] congratzjohn: That’s a hawker 700 or 800. It’s able to land gear up 3 times before it needs and overhaul. Otherwise just an inspection.
[206] supasmiddy: Emergency services on lunch break? Geez
[207] jefgie: Hate to ruin your story but it doesn’t look like he had any problems at all.
[208] vonteebs: As soon as the plane passed the first truck they should’ve been on the gas right bend it
[209] m_salvatar: Perhaps airports should build a crash lane where malfunctioning airplanes land with the best chances of survival?
[210] john.stavinoha: Where’s the foam?
[211] joes1958: Looked fairly easy to me.
[212] bucket.list702: Absolutely greased it
[213] blessing21213: That's notng but a miracle!
[214] chuckybenjamins: 1 million year before a fire truck pull up yall need to value ppl life more
[215] geodefray: FIRETRUCK?!
[216] harveycam_: I shot ts landing for the ABC station in Las Vegas onboard the stations helicopter. The plane actually landed on 19L (the 25 info is wrong) after circling the valley a few times to burn of some more fuel before it landed. The angle I was at was on the planes left side and had a great shot of the door and the 6 passengers, Pilot & Co-Pilot getting out of the aircraft.
[217] ragnorokaltheim: And no solid wall at the end of the runway
[218] pnutzs: Stunning application of Rule 1, fly what ya got as good as ya can, it might just be good enough
[219] relocate2austinwscott: Ts pilot deserves a metal as the difficulty to do ts without tumbling the plane and wings going boom. Bravo
[220] ryasc0: I bet ts guy wouldn't have ran s helicopter into a plane. what a pro.
[221] 2p.4.u: The last lil plume of fire was crazy!
[222] pin_chaser300: I would be SPRINTING out of that plane
[223] octaneray: Ts was caused by the weight of the pilots massive balls.
[224] joeystaricco: Real question: do you have to depressurize the cabin and kill the engines for ts? I’d assume eliminating risk with pressurized oxygen by burning fuel would be ideal?
[225] sg6_shadowman_trty3: The plane that just had ts issue but everyone died was failed by the ones directing it.
[226] _maximalinvasiv_: No fire and rescue stand by
[227] creepytruckingmiessnerrl: Pilot did an amazing job laying her down.
[228] franciscullimore: You’d tnk there’d be a few emergency crews standing by? Nah mate your on ya own
[229] james.alio: An example of true skill.
[230] fightlike_hell: Difficult? he made it look easy.
[231] hooflungpooo: Why isn't there a fire truck right there?
[232] vaquerogamingtwitch: Looks smoother than some flights I've been on
[233] cyntafry007: Great job by the pilot
[234] disasterline: My grandpa did ts in the middle of WW2 in a p47
[235] tmansparky: Love the little flaming *tadaaaa* at the end
[236] wel.mech.01: Bro how hard can it be to just t the ground
[237] samina.catira: WOW
[238] jadencold: Wow, that st’s crazy
[239] venitianhopkido: Talented pilot
[240] eeffen_smiff: Holy st
[241] sampaio.alcino: Muito bem. Mas o outro fez tudo bem e apareceu lhe um muro na frente!
[242] bobc85x: Well done.
[243] duncan.barnes.16szzuu0d0: The emergency services were crap!!!
[244] donderro5133: .Mm
[245] luisandrade98892: Great pilot!!
[246] simon.stclairmiller: Were the emergency services on a tea break?
[247] super_mario_tejas: fire trucks on strike
[248] doovie369: The 2 smoke rings at the end were pretty badass
[249] speedairways: Great landing bravo
[250] j.burden_photo: Absolutely buttered it though
[251] davidnunnery505: That was still pretty excellent
[252] blankwavenyc: Beautiful flame out
[253] mvrtingalarza: That tu. Way was long though.
[254] austinhomeseeker: That’s a pilot right there!
[255] jasonshaw43: Firefighters weren't in much of a hurry
[256] fredrik_ch: Why no foam on the runway?
[257] jack_jack_daniels_68: You never want to land a plane on water.
[258] srinath_arulmani: 
[259] neutronstar73: I was working at LAS at the time and for the life of me I don't remember ts at all.
[260] unclerairai: Well done!
[261] lessgounder: I do ts all the time in War Thunder
[262] joshdalberto: Long time ago
[263] sgreysond: Scritchy scratch, I’m comin in fast
[264] o.g.herm: Frontier needs to take notes
[265] molinarifoto: And the firemen?
[266] wevererwin: Where are the fire departement???? Lunch ????
#omg
[267] msfs_airways: Now imagine if it had a standard engine layout. Oof
[268] dshuganak: Shoulda put the little wheels down before tting the ground !
[269] jrandykrauss: Oh fuck that. Expect
[270] dark_country1: I could do ts blindfolded
[271] lil_depress1: The fact that he did ts so well
[272] i.wil.luv.choi.lots: Wow!
[273] cg.regg: my first week with the cartel
[274] extramile123: Terrible airport crew
[275] daniel_grbn: Hell yeah
[276] cmarras_: Yeah, these days they just head for Pladelpa
[277] princeoflagos: The fire fighters are so quick
[278] kushconnoisseur_to: I thought ts was cartelgram for a second
[279] markparmelee5062: Should have splurged and bought the plane with landing gear!
[280] treyrahman: Medal
[281] mewithdogs: Seems good to me.
[282] stvnkem: How could such a double failure occur? & where are the firefighters? Did they dump the fuel prior landing?
[283] kasper_mdj: Smoother than Ryan air
[284] ynacio_art: Wow
[285] hfrazier1: Doesn’t look that hard
[286] shxtbox_andrew: i’ve done it in gta can’t be that hard
[287] romancesluis: Tray that with a boeing
[288] theprimaryconsumer: I could do it
[289] restout777: Outstanding!
[290] fluoritefansonly: The metal skid bar is designed to grind away as the plane lands. Ts pilot is awesome, iv met m before working on s hawker.
[291] mikol.douglas.pro: What on earth is the pyroshow at the end?
[292] kshas3: What was the airspeed at landing and what would have been ideal? Perhaps closer to stall?
[293] lookphoto.studio: What was that burst at the end?
[294] jimpaulineconnor: foam should have been sprayed on the runway why did ts not happen ?
[295] mikejtrud: Smoother landing then my last frontier airlines flight
[296] porterjustporter: That landing was butter though
[297] las.taccountever: I tnk the tilted drift is what ultimately stopped it
[298] rapporboy: Slow trumpton must have been eating bacon sandwiches as usual?
[299] ts_is_mxoli: Firetrucks? Dafuk?
[300] micael.licciardi: Classic landing on war thunder
[301] wojtas_shmodus: I really thought they pre-foamed the runway for instances like ts
[302] koller_anthony: I hope they left a nice tip to the air hostess
[303] m4jeed_4m_blr: Was the emergency crew sleeping?
[304] mitchpaul87: That was a pretty damn buttery landing for having no gear or flaps…
[305] mccueben: Why didn’t the pilot just eject
[306] serg_k19: 
[307] iamsucces: Where is the fire department?
[308] muttnick_: looks fine to me. i would still not clap
[309] twilight_on_the_trail: I would be hugging that pilot
[310] przemyslaw008: Nawet straży nie było??
[311] curious_rash: Great job Pilot!
[312] ariefclc_019: Bener2 Jago pilot nya
[313] capncupojoe: ow oof ouch owie ow
[314] mikehenry3454: That pilot is never paying for drinks at an airport bar again
[315] nikaz__: Kind of helps when there is no brick wall right at the end of the runway… ✈️
[316] petetats76: Also helps when there’s not a cement wall at the end.
[317] ruth_templeton_: Great job
[318] 1gnatz: Can small planes like ts dump fuel before emergency landing?
[319] m5runner: Pilot is a fucking ACE.
[320] renzo_villa: That light show at the end was satisfying. Lol
[321] toby_messenger_: ‘Thank you for flying Ryanair’
[322] clrailey: People don’t understand life is life. St happens
[323] farinabodrum: he dumped s fuel before landing
[324] pegan649: Fire services should have been waiting...
[325] rantakoja: fire fighters missing in the airport????
[326] nosleinad18: try it upside down
[327] timothy_lasage: Not one live stream or selfie.  Just people immediately off and away from the plane
[328] reallygreatidea: More bumps in grass , greater likelihood of flipping
[329] zallen_coy: I can do that with my eyes closed
[330] warpdaddy: They had planes in the 1900's?
[331] spaceboyppie: I’m not sure but I tnk they want friction. On grass it will just slip forever.
[332] johnh.mckenzie: Cigar butt plane ,
[333] jvstplsh: People have trouble with driving a car that is more than 4 times smaller. Of course landing without a without the gear is difficult.
[334] mikeb.2112: those cessna 172 are fireproof
[335] dolan.aaron: Ts will be a normal landing soon enough at the rate we’re going.
[336] gregbyrne5552: Where are the emergency vecles ??
[337] dis_fellow271: That was beautiful
[338] deathro2517: On a sunny day
[339] jddg1: Ah, those Hawkers and their molybdenum steel skids at the base of the fuselage, built like the proverbial brick outhouse.  Toughest little jets ever built
[340] monekerr: Difficult? It seems super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I'm sure it wasn't easy for the pilot, but if landing a plane with no gear was an Olympic event ts one would get all 9.9s.
[341] oc_kelly2003: Smoooooooooth ....
[342] bernard_macdonald: Where the flaps at least configured before they failed?
[343] robkietzman: They flew it on not slamming it into the runway. Big difference.
[344] definity75: The illegals are making a run for it.
[345] lenna.casual: Parabéns ao piloto
[346] paul.a.christensen.7: Where's the emergency vecles
[347] jbarrymiles: What, no-one stopped running so they could then turn and film it?
[348] marwell86: Is it beyond repair after ts landing?
[349] spacelabexpress: Emergency vecles took too long to arrive at the scene! They can anticipate the where the plane was going to end and be ready to douse the flames but no one insight!!!! Lucky the plane didnt burst into flames!
[350] gejooste: Planes should be designed with skid plates on their bellies to aid such a landing.
[351] puffpuffcharlie: Ts isn't an easier landing, that is a fast plane and lands at a similar airspeed to the bigger passenger planes. s landing speed is probably close to 170knots wle a normal small plane would have a max speed similar to that and a landing speed of 60-70knots. Incredibly different experiences.
[352] krysmnc: When will the fire department come? Next year?
[353] sebbiemc: wheres the pissing fire crew
[354] richardaclinker: That's gonna leave a mark. On the aircraft and the runway...
[355] la_social__: Did the fire fighters arrive the next day?
[356] fotografia_paysdereve: Is t that true that generally planes are designed to be able to land like that?
[357] agus.haryanto92: Billy landing
[358] jerryjetson192: Don't know why it said that you can see how difficult it is because it didn't. The pilot made it look easy.
[359] cameronforsythart: Where were the fire trucks?
[360] amaury.v.rodrigues: Os bombeiros estavam de folga nesse dia
[361] leroyjoel: Et pourquoi les pompiers absents?
[362] winegrek: No foam on the strip and no emergency equipment.
[363] jens_kneis: #xrp
[364] kirdney.suerken: Imagine that with strong side winds. The pilot is top of top
[365] johannesb94: Amazing pilon
[366] watch_life79: I am most shocked about how long it takes for the fire trucks to arrive. we are in the 21st central. drones?
[367] flatbush_kidd: 
[368] mr.moslem_latifi: باید یه قابلیت بذارن برای تخلیه کاما سوخت در مواقع ضروری برای جلوگیری از انفجار هواپیما
[369] 17_.baht: also, gh chance of the fuel tank fucking exploding
[370] mosa_libra: The automatic extinguishers did their job perfectly
[371] palagonia.peter.arts: The Hawker Sidley is a tough jet for its size class, stronger than a learned to be sure.  Now where the hell was the groundcrew ?  Fire engine, to greet or aid the passengers?  I used to work at an airport, and a small one at that, the fire department would've been driving along side thr runway, and the airport is supposed to have it's own fire engine at that.  Where are the EMTs on standby rusng to them?  Big big fails here but that was EXCELLENT piloting.
[372] pab4elk: Good tng those fire trucks were Johnny on the spot! Oh wait they were probably still in their jammies or having breakfast!
[373] florinvif.3er: In both cases are overspeeding. When you are in those cases in the final aproach you should kill all the velocity to manage to stop more faster.
[374] jcrazy101: I can’t believe there were no emergency personnel there to put out the fire
[375] realmasonmiller: I bet that was loud af
[376] mansl: Why not do as the military planes. Put a lot of foam on runway!
[377] kabirbageria: Remarkable! And the fire was actually really cool to see (albeit scary of course!)
[378] russian_diy_geek: now they put foam to make it smooth
[379] txe_magic: @fernitic
[380] allansnider: I tnk that’s the one where the technician left s flashlight inside the retractable gear location
[381] dtgevolution: Amazing job by the pilot!
[382] gabscan_vivian: Better than Ryanair
[383] ijustkepttravelling: "Another happy landing"
[384] pitbossbob: WHY DON'T THEY' LAND ON THE GRASS?????
[385] captrcweiss: In the movies, the fire trucks are already there waiting.
[386] wesleydoll1: looked pretty simple
[387] iamyourdata: Just missing a brick wall at the end
[388] enriquealbacorte: No rivers? Pls 100% pilot fault
[389] theoneandonlytraviscox: I'm surprised that the fire department didn't foam up the runway first.
[390] danielking.act: It's probably been thought of, but I wonder if a runway could be built for emergency landings?
[391] marco_ubirajara: Why is the fireman waiting for them?
[392] solmgren: You could survive ts in the days before DEI res.
[393] bambutattoo_: No reverse thrusters!  That landing was hot butter tho
[394] wintrover: 무안공항이 만들어낸 재앙이다
[395] 1008gramz_: EVERYTNG AIRPORT SHOULD HAVE A FRICTIONLESS EMERGENCY LANDING STRIP
[396] ayteguhpranoto: NASCAR
[397] dolwolfianphotography: No fkn wall in the end of runway!
[398] aye_mr.mingo: My toxic trait? I could totally do ts, not sure if the towers will hold… but I can do ts
[399] thompsonb1sanjay: Even if that Jeju flight landed at the very start of the runway,  it would've still crashed into the mountain built at the end of the runway
[400] samyaza_azza: How nobody thought to invent and flush system  throughout the bottom of the plane to put out the fire? Or how bout invent an inflatable tube under the plane that act like airbags when the plane ts the ground!!
[401] cooperstooks: If there’s no gear my pilot better chose to land in water or grass
[402] fb1223344: They missed the giant concrete wall at the end of the runway
[403] jayli.import: 
[404] selcukunlu88: Helal lan sana
[405] vailcollective: Parachute technology for planes should be a tng
[406] gold_roll_motors: 
[407] adkm: yea that Jeju air were so unfortunate as the runway too short for emergency landing like that and got concrete as the final blow.
[408] 3138lesnik: Где пожарные машины? Должны были быть уже на полосе.
[409] prym_5: 90s was just for Pros in today's lives the considered professionals knows notng and when they do a little bit out of the norm you find 89 firetrucks ,27 police and 8 helicopters to applaud then for tiny efforts of enduring a turbulance .. i love ts handling of business like damn man thats good
[410] hjqxy: You will be repaired in 30 seconds
[411] pentaquarkgluons: The flames at the end were like: WE ARE BACK!
[412] thesuperone1: Duh.
[413] chrismaierx: So, exactly how you'd land a plane normally?
[414] mugsybn1999: Firefighters on break???
[415] mulangira31: In South Korea they put a concrete barrier to end the runway and it doesn’t end well.
[416] kudou_tomoya: Good tng that the fire stopped
[417] birkyboy01: Did he press Q and E to slow down faster?
[418] fire_blackford_hcs_basketball: Good work!
[419] kevinatjw: Damn, props to the pilot. Rougher landings were had with flaps and gear intact.
[420] benjaminleviston: A real "OG" would've slid it up to the gate!!!
[421] noeyorrk: I feel like it should be standard practice that all main airports have their runways end into big flat fields or water.
[422] jazzinconsultorfiat: Parabéns ao piloto, mas todos aí saíram cagados, certeza
[423] gregroffey: Pretty amazing landing, pilot has some skills
[424] backinazmissingla: Massive kudos for the crew!!!
[425] z4xx0r: Fantastic landing given the awful situation, but why did runway 26R become 25R? Did it rotate 10 degrees, or was it off to begin with?
[426] chad_evans28: Why don’t they deploy the nets that aircraft carriers use to catch the plane and slow it’s momentum??
[427] gaeldelestier: Pas de pompiers en bout de piste ???
[428] international.shona.nomad: Trucks took wayyy too likg
[429] maximusjkeller: Not to meantion the engine is above the wings not below like bigger planes
[430] hristov.iskren: I'm not a pilot, but what about land on the grass next to the runaway? What is your opinion?
[431] kingmac910: That emergency crew was garbage
[432] pavel185bjj: Exactly !! It’s like no one cares about them
[433] dennis_carman: Flame out at the end. Why?
[434] bristolfooddude: Just find some grass. Less chance of fire
[435] fischersantosconstruction: It’s easier specially with no brick walls at the end of the runaway.
[436] che.tober: You can't touchdown witn the ideal 1000ft, can't steer, can't break, depending on friction only, all ts with 60% more speed because of the absent flaps. multiply the difficulty by 5 for the airliner scenario.
[437] sgtrock27: Dumped s Fuel, glided it in, the reversed thrusters , ground crew and air control were ready...Korea incident... well wait for the investigation..but it won't bring them back ..sad
[438] scarfacescobar_: Blame that stupid wall in North Korea , no need for st like that on runways
[439] mariasriver: Terrible response time by fire trucks
[440] k.kitakaze: and i tnk that ts plane's engine is installed at the upper position causes gh frictions on the ground, it was stoppable comparing to the Jeju accident.

sorry my bad English
[441] el.tigre.del.norte: Bro nailed it though
[442] plc5eng: Where in the hall are fire and rescue? Having coffee?
[443] hmx414: Props to the pilot
[444] king_billy_b: Why didn’t he tried to land on water then
[445] robertxbennett: What would be wrong with planes having a parachute system out the back like a drag car or the shuttle had . The tngs cost millions anyway another few hundred thousand could sack a lot of lives
[446] thacarchaeologist: Did they dump the fuel before landing?
[447] oldwestleatherusa: Was there a fire suppression system on board. Sure looked like it.
[448] sklip808: As long as there isn't any tck concrete wall at the runway
[449] zarmora1: Notice how at the end of runway, isn't a fucking concrete barrier
[450] jayjvaughn: No fire crew is nuts. They had so much time to prepare and take action on ts one.
[451] msc_cruises_the_best: Everyone looked a  little skiddish
[452] pauldmcclainlll3: McCarran Intl Airport 97 or 98.. I was working there for Clark County.
[453] gymnastigga: 1999 AI
[454] randyistnking: You can't ask for better than that.
[455] berrymateusen: The forbidden skidmark
[456] callumashe: Seriously great job from the fire brigade.
[457] bnnbrdbwns: Can see the ground effect making it hard to touch ground even
[458] ericsantiago23: 
[459] joel_frank99: That should buff out
[460] tacosik.blinkeau: Good tng that runway didn’t have a concrete wall there for no reason like the Koreams
[461] secretli1: Considering there isn't a wall at the end of the runway, yeah.
[462] deadprofile1227: Is an aircraft damaged like ts done for or do they make back into service?
[463] mrdodger81: 
[464] suckmylozenge: It’s a piece of piss, I do it all the time.
[465] elicates: I do ts all the time
[466] one_weird_devil: Well done, that’s a very skilled airmen.
[467] bizzybrad1: Hawkers were built to fly the Queen. They all have a reinforced underbelly for that purpose
[468] advanced_vision_security: Lucky the fire crew were there.
[469] rap_torrr: Check LOT polish captain Wrona 2011 and learn
[470] z4nedurtpt2: Wtf wall are these guys talking about? We watcng the same video?
[471] tre_perdue: The pilot must be incredible skilled
[472] tylerheacox: Who tf thought it would be easy???
[473] danny.spang: No concrete wall to pancake the plane like in South Korea
[474] dsvendsen_01: Why didn’t they foam the runway
[475] sojcjoineryandconstructions: What about a grass runway, would that be a better substitute for landing wle disabled?
[476] jason_mpower: Don’t understand why airports don’t have a runway where you can land without gear, using some kind of floor that doesn’t ignite the under carriageway.
[477] _mc_allen: Good tng there wasn’t a concrete wall at the end of the runway.
[478] ian.naden: It actually looked very easy
[479] klubby26: Looks easy
[480] johanlillebaek: Give that pilot a beer
[481] tompilotentrepreneurcook: Balance between LDA and how well you put it down !
[482] realchriscane: They not running fast enough for me
[483] brianelliswrites: I’ve had united landjngs that were bumpier. That was scary as hell but smooth as fuck or did it just look that way
[484] kauaikid73: Now that's an experienced pilot. Too bad Korea didn't have them flying
[485] o_pai_fpv: At least he didn't had a wall at the end of the runway
[486] teamstripesross: That's how it's done
[487] maksimkatog: What wall are ppl talking about in the comments?
[488] scott_inkson: Why haven’t they laid foam down
[489] emanuelre21: They should have a special airstrip for those kind of  emergency landing
[490] justaguyproduction: 
[491] willybk777: You can see he pulls the controls back after the plane loses lift to put as much friction as possible between the plane and runway
[492] jullio.k: Fire works running around park and sing some music 6 am
[493] josmer.suero: Plane is just totalled isn't?
[494] tennesseearborist: Gosh they got so lucky. Lucky there wasn’t a localizer on a mound and a concrete wall…
[495] dj.sartaj:

[17] aella_athar: Celebrating cheating? Audacity
[18] the.aishwaryaabrari: To be completely honest, ts time you seem like an auntie, wle Kareena stole the show and looks younger than you. You looked fresh, but more like an older lady….

You are just an amateur and after the accident you became a little girl putting on a pathetic performance in Formula 1. I wish I had the chance you have to sne, because my best would be little.

Vinicius de Moraes
De tudo, ao meu amor serei atento
Antes, e com tal zelo, e sempre, e tanto
Que mesmo em face do maior encanto
Dele se encante mais meu pensamento
Quero vivê-lo em cada vão momento
E em seu louvor hei de espalhar meu canto
E rir meu riso e derramar meu pranto
Ao seu pesar ou seu contentamento
E assim, quando mais tarde me procure
Quem sabe a morte, angústia de quem vive
Quem sabe a solidão, fim de quem ama
Eu possa me dizer do amor (que tive)
Que não seja imortal, posto que é chama
Mas que seja infinito enquanto dure

Vinicius de Moraes
De tudo, ao meu amor serei atento
Antes, e com tal zelo, e sempre, e tanto
Que mesmo em face do maior encanto
Dele se encante mais meu pensamento
Quero vivê-lo em cada vão momento
E em seu louvor hei de espalhar meu canto
E rir meu riso e derramar meu pranto
Ao seu pesar ou seu contentamento
E assim, quando mais tarde me procure
Quem sabe a morte, angústia de quem vive
Quem sabe a solidão, fim de quem ama
Eu possa me dizer do amor (que tive)
Que não seja imortal, posto que é chama
Mas que seja infinito enquanto dure

Vinicius de Moraes
De tudo, ao meu amor serei atento
Antes, e com tal zelo, e sempre, e tanto
Que mesmo em face do maior encanto
Dele se encante mais meu pensamento
Quero vivê-lo em cada vão momento
E em seu louvor hei de espalhar meu canto
E rir meu riso e derramar meu pranto
Ao seu pesar ou seu contentamento
E assim, quando mais tarde me procure
Quem sabe a morte, angústia de quem vive
Quem sabe a solidão, fim de quem ama
Eu possa me dizer do amor (que tive)
Que não seja imortal, posto que é chama
Mas que seja infinito enquanto dure

[10] kyrthe: In almost the entire world recreational cannabis is illegal, in the UsA it’s selective legal (not all states legalised it completely if l am correct).
When someone is so in love with weed and all s life is surrounded by ts, sells cannabis products under s brand name, then ts becomes a business and not simply a lifestyle. The sad tng is these images can be viewed by people all over the world, by kids and teenagers who admire Mr Bieber. Ts man just flaunts s only care in the world, he is dedicated to make weed use as mainstream as possible without consideration of the consequences and the impact it has.
[11] jesusgirl67: Everyone is saying it’s just weed…. Well I definitely tnk that if you need to be gh most of the time you are covering up your pain

[21] liz_mo78: You need to grow up and start acting like a father. He’s priority now not your weed and not your friends.
[22] jhoanna_veraah: Las drogas nunca dejan nada bueno.
[23] wylelmina: You need to go to rehab like most celebrities I guess...you also need therapy, that's what your friends, your family and your close entourage should push you to do...instead of having you posting your addictions on ig. What on earth your circle is doing letting you go off like that...I'm glad I'm not a celebrity,  you all seem so surrounded by people who don't care about you...

[28] scatterowl313: Weed isn’t a hard drug for those of you that need to hear it. And honestly, it can be extremely mentally helpful. Not saying it can’t also be ndering too.
But let ts dude live s life… it’s not yours.
[29] el_wizza_: Cop your sovs before biebs picks one uo and the prices skyrocket

[34] kemmaben: Dude, cmon. PLEASE get some help. We don’t want to loose you. But more importantly, YOUR SON doesn’t deserve ts. He deserves s father, s DAD, to be a damn Dad, bro! Ts ain’t it.
[35] rbccmsn: These people commenting are wild. Like, are parents allowed to have a couple drinks? Maybe even post a bottle of wine or a fun summer cocktail they’re enjoying? Same fucking tng. Y’all need to cll out and stop inferring he’s a bad dad for letting loose once in a wle.
[36] lbell2176: Alot of Christians smoke. Leave the poor guy alone for awle.
[37] bobbiplows: Oh give over , alcohol is a lot more damaging , same as all these drugs prescribed by doctors, cannabis is a plant with a lot of medicinal purposes !!! Wake up!!!
[38] queenzax: Ts comment section sucks......
[39] mummashezcooks: Boy needs help for god sake.  He will end up like Liam Payne. Leaving a baby bend.
[40] morrison.janice: And having a beer is ok right ! Grow up people pot is legal in Canada 🇨🇦. Just like a beer is . Not going to give your kid a beer . Why would anyone tnk he   would smoke around kid . That’s why he is by mself !
[41] cosy_cat_illustration: Do you know what was bad for me as a cld? Seeing my father drunk. s loss of control. You need help! Your cld needs you. Whatever is driving you to ts self-destruction, you have to fight against it. You are a father now, you have responsibilities.
[42] mirandaraeallday: Get out of here weed haters he’s one of us
[43] murphrob: Holy cow!!! Y'all need to cll the f*ck, mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down!. It's weed! It's less dangerous than alcohol but if he was drinking no one would say a damn tng! So many people still believing all the over hyped weed propaganda from Nixon is absolutely insane. Y'all really gotta use your brains more than that.
[44] xxangelinaminiclli: Dads drink damn beer with their kids all day and play with their kids and yall praise them . Yall act like ts is some crack .
[45] christaroo: Apparently fatherhood has triggered some deeply emotional wounds that you’re seemingly trying to numb. Your son deserves you at your best. These are times you’ll never get back and you’re spending it gh. Very sad.
[46] siejmo: People hating on m as if half the population doesn’t smoke pot. It’s legal in so many states and I really don’t see how ts is a big deal.
[47] cha__fernandez: @haileybieber dude your man is addicted do sometng before it’s too late
[48] truthonthebayou: Personally I'm not a fan of weed for myself.. however I'm not ignorant either. It is a God given plant that grows naturally and heals people.✨️ He is healing ffrom quite a lot ! Let m be.
[49] moreninha_min: Your pothead will take care of your son
[50] katie657607: Smoking weed is fine but flexing your bong all over IG when you have a kid is craaazzy
[51] caitlynsurdel: Why is everyone acting like he’s smoking around s son? Do you see s son in any of the pictures? Because I don’t. He’s a grown fucking man, let m smoke weed if he fucking wants to like tf
[52] fairyganjamotha: Y'all tnk ts is any different than a picture of someone holding a beer can? Wake TF up. He's fine.
[53] yeoitsjoe: Biebs with the Illy
[54] xxchelle01: I tnk it’s telling that a lot of these comments are ridiculing Justin just to forget what’s been going on the past few months.. did we all forget he was around diddy for YEARS as a cld & we are just NOW finding out what happened. It’s possible it could stem from that. Yes, finding help should be a priority, but shaming someone into getting help, won’t work. We also have to empatze that we have no idea the trauma he’s endured & we don’t get to tell others how to heal from issues some will never know
[55] boro.kevo: get ts guy a proper @sovereigntyglass smfh

If u god forbid die from ur addiction he wont even remember u, cause hes so tiny, n peoples memories start at list at three years old, but he willl see one day when he grows up s dads self distruction on social media n everywhere. What kind of person will he grow up to be if ts happens, god forbid??? Do u really want m to grow up with s terrible mother, to grow up to have herr qualities n be like her?? I dont tnk so. I also dont tnk u want to die, i just tnk ure confused n tired n need to talk to someone n to get some help. I tnk about u more than once a day, wch is rare for me, thatt means ure like my family, n nott a stranger, n i also pray for u quite a lot, wch is also pretty unusual for me.

[58] blue3yebbyphotography: @haileybieber what the fuck was he on yo
[59] vendredi.13: Stop copying me
[60] shellyavishag: Dont u tnk maybe jesus sent mee n the other people who tell u to quit n go to rehab cause he wants u to do it? God works in mysterious ways honey, dont forget that!!!!!! Ii believe in jesus, just not in the way youu doo. I believe hes an angel n he watches over me with the rest of the angels, the dead riechous people. Like my grandparents n the dead people in my family who were richous, n all the richous people from the jewish bible (old testament) n all the richous people in story who r now dead, theyre all my angels, watcng over me alwayss!!!!!! Also all the dead animals in the world r my angels, n my cat cldren who passed away r also my angels. So listen to jesus, ur god, cause he sent me to u, n he doesnt do tngs for notng. U need to hurry up there kid, u dont have all the time in the world, u r in amidiatee dangerr, n each moment that passes its more like that. U can always write me on facebook n or instagram, n i promiss to eventually reply, its just that im so very busy all the time, so it might take me a few days or so.

[585] dunhammelendez2005: Wish people would pray and not be so negative ....clearly the guy was draggd all over every social media platform due to cld hood trama. Let the kid sorts out s life everyone sitting they trying to say hes using substances. What because he did before? Do you got prof? Or just stirring a pot adding to s plate. T os great reason why hes shutting s circle smaller and the world hasnt seen s cld i dont blame m one bit. Its sad that people work hard change there life for the better yet he smokes some legal weed and now hes a drug addict. Ok sit back ask urself ts ..... Did ur parents smoke? im sure they tried. Better yet ur grandparents you know they did hello every ppie did . I guess that would make everyones family be addicts ,users whatever you want to say . Now if u see a picture with m and s kid and m smoking then i guess if u want to judge then... but until then  what he does on s personal time  leave m alone. Hes a new dad new husband someones son ,father,brother,nephew. Let m live dang INTERNENT BULLIES PERIOD.

[591] xxchelle01: I tnk it’s telling that a lot of these comments are ridiculing Justin just to forget what’s been going on the past few months.. did we all forget he was around diddy for YEARS as a cld & we are just NOW finding out what happened. It’s possible it could stem from that. Yes, finding help should be a priority, but shaming someone into getting help, won’t work. We also have to empatze that we have no idea the trauma he’s endured & we don’t get to tell others how to heal from issues some will never know

[669] ragnoproduction: I find it funny everybody hating when the reality is that lots of kids from very proper families grow up to be addicts. Sometimes being super strict and not honest will set your cld up for failure. The forbiden fruit tastes the sweetest. Did you tnk you want be an alcoholic when your parents were drunk? No. And dont come telling me weed is a gateway drug and alcohol isnt when alcohol for me is a much bigger enabler for tngs.

JB never said or did anytng to hurt anyone, if anytng we should all be supporting m after everytng we have found out from s past. yall need to grow up.
[787] kaushal145: You're in a phase of seeking short-term thrills. Your mind is craving validation and acceptance from others. Whoever got you into substances is clearly struggling with their own demons. But you're not like that, you have a great life. Stop searcng for problems and focus on the positives.

Ha portato le tue trasgressioni  e tramite le sue lividure siamo liberi… voglio solo dirti che se continui una volta conosciuto Cristo torni indietro la tua condizione primaria tornerà peggiore di 7 volte tanto ..abbandona rinuncia il peccato  di no al nemico resisti gli in faccia  Gesù ti ama ti comprende ti perdona ma cede soltanto di darci il tuo cuore né soldi né lusso né altre solo il tuo cuore

[10] green_vwiitch: I am so sorry... I was so excited to finally see our Ibram and kus.. but  MY GOD.... what the fuck was that?... like.. wat?... I need exorcism after ts movie...
[11] randombs1234_: Why is my opinion so different.. I LOVED THE MOVIE. It's a sweet simple watch. Ofc there's a lot to work on for the new actors, but people are way too harsh towards them
[12] tone_and_texture_tales: I dont understand why did @iakpataudi  risked s debut, he was not bad may be he will be polished but kus i dont even know why is she even an casted to spoil s first film. The hair style was totally diff from the actual ibram is… it didn’t even felt like i was watcn a movie. Anyways i watched it for @iakpataudi and i liked m…
[13] kypton223: Girl please learn how to act. Really want to support you but you make it so hard. You could’ve taken acting lessons to start modelling. Why everyone wants to become an actor?
[14] nehousha27: Honestly, i was feeling so bored already . I dont know if its the story or the lead actors…
[15] t4n_isha: Guys give ts movie some credit, it solved my insomnia. Never slept so fast
[16] justadilx: You guys have nerve promoting such a st show
[17] newaz_andy: Ibram is a true hero material but they couldn’t utilize m properly, specially due to khusi’s poor performance Ibram’s debut destroyed.

[23] li_toka: Loved the movie.. the casting was perfect .. wish the movie was a lil longer.
[24] musha19067: At ts point, Nadhaniyan is so painfully dull that even elevator music has more emotional depth. And Khus Kapoor? She seriously needs acting lessons from a first-year theatre student at Ambani School. Expressionless, stiff, and lacking any screen presence how does one make every scene feel like a gh school rehearsal gone wrong? Bollywood needs to stop handing out roles like party favors and start demanding actual talent.
[25] suzannamukherjee: Like it was a written by a 5 year old
[26] juphatak: istg the script like dialogues dubbing everytng looked so fake like tf i had good expectations but nvm ig
[27] paandaaa_1997: @khuskapoor you need to stop acting … haven’t seen a worst actor like you . Can’t even say you an actor . @iakpataudi  you were good .. could have been paired with a better co star . You debut was fine but could have been more better if it was not with @khuskapoor
[28] beens.world: Worst movie I have ever seen
[29] abcmodra: Like seriously....u guys have audacity to become actors
[30] nisha_0978patel: Honestly Khus listen, I am not writing ts to hate on you or talk about nepotism. You really need to put some hard work and sharpen your acting skills. Movies are not like your sweet lil fairy tail imagination, or girly Pinterest board! You need to understand how so many deserving actors don’t get the opportunities like you do. Then why can’t you go to acting school? Learn sometng! Now let’s talk about script, do you actually read it? Ts movie was a CRINGE BOMB! Not your fault but the writers and directors make or break an actors career. So reading the script before saying is a must, every min was so cringey so badly written, gave the trying too hard to be relatable to Gen Z vibes and failed terribly. People around you, your friends might tell you ignore the audience because they are hater but the truth is you need to pick wisely and need way more than just dressing up to be an actor! Just an advice you never asked for!
[31] shub_tripat25: @khuskapoor bad worst movie why you are even making movies
[32] ayshsinh_11: I tnk the comments summarise how poorly made ts film was. I wish Ibram chose a better film for s debut he still has a long way to go. However, I just wanted to say the other actors played so well , and special mention to Apoorva and here screen presence was way better than the lead actors!
[33] andreadsouzaa: Khus, please quit acting. You ruin even the most basic movies.
[34] m_meryam_: Tried hard to watch past 20 mins
[35] thequarterticketshow: Ci
[36] it_starts_with_me123: The movie isn't bad at all. It's lighthearted and there isn't any lag at all. If you love romance and happy endings ts is a great one time watch. The music adds to the charm. The character development of Arjun(Ibram) was great too. Loved watcng Ibram on screen definitely drool worthy. It's basically like a long music video. Arjun's and Pia's families were also portrayed well considering their dynamics. Overall, grab some parathas and binge on Nadaaniyan
[37] rakkkyyy08_: horrendous plot
[38] rakkkyyy08_: sunil shetty is the only one who did a decent job
[39] aa_nchal_: The movie sucked
[40] saumya_1202: give those 2 hours of my life back
[41] itsa_isha54: Worst film of 2025 didn’t expect ts from m first film that to with ts expressionless girl
[42] alisha_3107: People criticising just cause they are star kids is so unfair! I mean if you watch debut movies of all the megastars today be it it Salman, SRK, Ranbir no one was good in their first movie! But the world wasn’t as harsh back then that’s the difference.
[43] kanishkaa.changaa: Why are you in ts industry!?????
[44] yukta_b2: Even the acting was fake !

[51] aishamin06: Why is the film dubbed
[52] _.shan._.mac._: What a terrible movie and acting!!
[53] manisha_singz: Dubbing was really bad, 1st half was painfully dull. 2nd half little better. The angry emotions were dealt better than the romantic moments. Painfully Yours, honest viewer. KK as usual, 1 star ⭐️.
[54] creativetechnyc: Chheeee
[55] m_meryam_: You are beautiful but your acting sucks
[56] m_meryam_: Sorry to say ..Such a bad movie
[57] sanjana17b: @netflix_in  stop producing such movies !!!!
[58] flyingparatha: Why is the audio not mixed of the movie ?
The dub mix is not bad , it’s been forgotten to be mixed.

[64] muski111177: The dubbing is so so bad complete cringe

[66] mns.sks: Wat a worst film
[67] 1141.abdu: lanat yaar j wasted 2 hours of my busy life
[68] sepp_di: Woww
[69] therealmohsinshaikh: Story is bogus,what we expect from these gaand z generation kids
[70] zizilatif: What a load of st!
[71] riffetz: I mean I liked the story line and the emotional acting was kind of good but only if the acting could be a bit more realistic it would make a great rom com
[72] zizilatif: Story had so much potential, it seemed so rushed. The jokes could’ve been executed way better  and the emotional scenes. The director deffo messed ts up. The actors can only do what the director wants.
[73] __alooo____: People are hating everytng these days . Ts movie was so cute .
[74] myra.uttamchandani: Loved the movie!!!!
[75] ranjani.krishnan1984: Couldn't even bear ten mins!!! @khuskapoor plssssssss don't torture is like ts! I haven't seen anyone with such a st face card.even A of acting u don't know....ithna gatiya story...my god....
[76] affirmtob: It was good, didn’t like the ending though!
[77] fizzachaudhary_: The most worst actress @khuskapoor back to back flops. You act like a robot. Time waste movie
[78] fizzachaudhary_: @karanjohar shame on you for back to back flop. Are you blind why you cast ts robot khus kapoor and you are planning to launch shanaya seriously. What’s in your head.? No emotions no acting skills. Even they can’t dubbing themselves. Horrible
[79] dheehere: I thought Khus would be the only insufferable one, but nooo, Ibram, you've been horrible too!
[80] memoryhoarder2017: If bollywood is a toilet, ts movie is a st floating in the flush.
[81] memoryhoarder2017: 
[82] memoryhoarder2017: 
[83] afreen_asif_: Just watched it for ibram
[84] just_28float: Couldn't even watch for 15 minutes. Khudkus Kapoor's acting looked as fake as her nose, and IAK's dialogue delivery was terrible. No wonder ts garbage was sold to Netflix because Dharma knew it would be a huge flop in theaters. But I wouldn’t be surprised if these two nepo kids keep getting movies one after another.
[85] afreen_asif_: There were times where ibram looked like palak, he was good in the movie.
[86] shriya_shah95: Ibram deserved a better debut!
[87] nitassha_k: What a cute movie. Really enjoyed both Ibram and Khus's performances
[88] chefmeghaa: Loved the movie
[89] theniteenpatil: Another nepokid dumping in bollywood
[90] kanishkk.aa: Please ask them to take acting classes ! What a terrible movie !!!
[91] bx.dollar_: @khuskapoor I want to say a massive well done to you! Your acting in ts movie (Nadaaniyan) has been phenomenal the best I’ve seen so far. I tnk you have great potential in the acting profession. I tnk you have a massive talent and you can one day match your mother the great late Sridevis acting talent. I tnk you should open up more and attempt to dance more freely and explore more genres of films. Then hopefully you can get the rewards and credits you deserve.
[92] msekhon78: story was bakwas but Ibram did an amazing job , kus performance was so poor
[93] malikaaboufassa: Definitely the best !!!
[94] boho_sapien01: @iakpataudi  abbu ko bolo acting ke class lagaye tumhare …
[95] niharikagupta7830: मूवी फ्लॉप
[96] nahnah_khadii: I don’t know why you all Indians are being so hate.ful,I watched the movie and it was so so nice and great tbh!!
[97] artbyrima1: Watched it ts evening and enjoyed it. Storyline is simple and light-hearted, and targeted for the young adult audience.
[98] natashashweet: Kapoor family is in the race for the baddest acting Sonam Arjun now khus
[99] soomro4119: Flop
[100] me_miss.roy: 10 munit jhelneke baad jhela ne geya
[101] iampratikpai: Movie was disappointing, & whats with the dubbing?
[102] xo_sherry_xo: Loved it!!
[103] aymenalikazmi: I may be just an unknown voice in the crowd, but I felt compelled to share that acting might not be your strongest suit. There’s a disconnect between your facial expressions and your voice. Why not explore a different passion that resonates more with you? Tnk about it
[104] izmaasrar: Honestly just felt forced. Could be a one time watch. Khus kapoor CANNOT act..should leave the acting to her sister jhanvi. Ibram has potential. Needs a bit of polisng. Lovely seeing mama, dia, rot back on screen
[105] spicyycheetosmom: Okay so if you like soft romance movies or let's say k dramas then I tnk you would enjoy ts...the acting was fine...the songs were good... characteres were good overall it's a good watch if you are into Wattpad k dramas stuff
[106] cypherking01: Tatti , nepotism,  st flick
[107] damdisorder: disappointed in ibram
[108] damdisorder: i watched ts movie for @iakpataudi @______iak______ but he kinda disappointed me maybe he will do sometng in future and anybody noticed abf the dubbing?
[109] damdisorder: im not getting it why people are trolling khus more ibram was the one we all were expecting good acting? right? he did disappointed
[110] mk.justahuman: Sorry @iakpataudi you are amazing but your female lead just ruined your debut!
[111] wagmasaeed: What a fake movie !!!
[112] skarna21: @khuskapoor you need to learn acting first ...no expression at all
[113] __kuval__: Nihayiti ghatiya film

[117] zabariahnor5: i love the movie so much..for me u all did a great job.as a new comer u all carry the character very well..keep up guys..im so impress with@iakpataudi .
[118] ca_rudradave: Cringe pro max
[119] live_life_lady_nj: It was really good !!! @iakpataudi great job !! I can’t watch more movies of you ! Please continue working hard no matter what toxic commenters or people say … u rock a lot !!
[120] nashra__maheen: What a horrible movie. Ibram’s acting even worse than Khus wch I didn’t even know was possible. + Ibram’s voice?! What on earth was going on with that?
[121] sharma.47saurabh: ac movie hai @khuskapoor
[122] quentin62960: Why dubbed voice of Ibram
[123] svani141817: Brainrot movie worsened by acting
[124] ekenaster: The whole movie gave an uneasy feel, seems like ndi dubbed, especially İbram’s dialogue!
[125] teshapatel29: Such an awful acting.  Can't even watch for 10 mins. Worst acting. Such a waste
[126] anuragsharma91: Ts movie is a “criminal offense” #terrible
[127] malldon: Stop it plz such a fake acting of Ibram
[128] niharikaaa___________: Idk why but I felt it was dubbed am I the only one?
[129] saltybhabi: I liked it lol
[130] ks.writingz: Ibram bhai - im watcng movie - great presence .
[131] facto.facts: @khuskapoor  Khus!!! considering getting your teeth aligned might enhance your on-screen presence. It was a bit distracting in certain scenes, including the kiss scene. Just a thought!
[132] iam_vivekdhadwal: Nepo kids are useless and pathetic; they don’t even know how to act. Just because their fathers have a lot of money and contacts doesn’t mean they will make them superstars. Without acting talent, they are notng but clowns.

[73] kacz98: You are an incredible example to show to the world about how to not run the governing body of motorsport. A true inspiration as to how quickly you have degraded the validity of the FIA.

Your methods shape an FIA which is unbalanced, erratic, sly and devious. This motion of an 11th team was long in the works. You happened to be in charge when it happened but don't go believing you are the reason it happened. It was due to happen with whomever was in charge so long as they were not trying to block the thing.

 So well done for basically not screwing up I guess? You're scraping the get the credit bro. This is a bad look.

[614] kacz98: You are an incredible example to show to the world about how to not run the governing body of motorsport. A true inspiration as to how quickly you have degraded the validity of the FIA.

Your methods shape an FIA which is unbalanced, erratic, sly and devious. This motion of an 11th team was long in the works. You happened to be in charge when it happened but don't go believing you are the reason it happened. It was due to happen with whomever was in charge so long as they were not trying to block the thing.

 So well done for basically not screwing up I guess? You're scraping the get the credit bro. This is a bad look.

[631] mintchip05: Resign
[632] alex_khaute: Swear words are there to use when one is frustrated. F1 is not a children Tv show, it's man sport, if you can't digest swear words you don't deserve to be the FIA President.

[677] sahitya_sagar: BOOOOOOOOO !
[678] charlesdecard75015: stop talking nonsense before you didn't want this team and now they had to pay you a lot and you accept. you are a disaster for this beautiful sport that is formula 1, a disgrace. PS: it would be good to stop the stupid fines that you give to the driver, because they said a bad word, let them do it, they know their sport better than you.
[679] elias_ham44: Gerara here Mohammed

[1] sunnigl: Todo bien en casa?
[2] breal: Need you in the “smoke box”!!!
[3] feysnts: Hailey doesn't deserve this side of you
[4] gaga_sandwich: Is this already a cry for help or not yet?
[5] yuvalsaydof: התקופת סנטר הזאת לא הולמת אותך יקירי.
[6] kyrthe: In almost the entire world recreational cannabis is illegal, in the UsA it’s selective legal (not all states legalised it completely if l am correct).
When someone is so in love with weed and all his life is surrounded by this, sells cannabis products under his brand name, then this becomes a business and not simply a lifestyle. The sad thing is these images can be viewed by people all over the world, by kids and teenagers who admire Mr Bieber. This man just flaunts his only care in the world, he is dedicated to make weed use as mainstream as possible without consideration of the consequences and the impact it has.
[7] dananicolefarr: People need to chill
[8] kilikina1986: 1 Peter 5:8
"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour"
[9] kahentakon: Leave Justin alone , do you see him blowing smoke in his kids face ? Mind your business and respect the biebs
[10] jesusgirl67: Everyone is saying it’s just weed…. Well I definitely think that if you need to be high most of the time you are covering up your pain
[11] damianmaan11: Bro wants to switch his audience to acquired taste only
[12] martinjm909: El nuevo Free britney
[13] _ijskonijn_: Jezus Christ what is wrong with you!!
[14] dayanaquintaniilla: Can we call CPS on them? Or that doesn’t apply to the rich?
[15] xxchelle01: I think it’s telling that a lot of these comments are ridiculing Justin just to forget what’s been going on the past few months.. did we all forget he was around diddy for YEARS as a child & we are just NOW finding out what happened. It’s possible it could stem from that. Yes, finding help should be a priority, but shaming someone into getting help, won’t work. We also have to empathize that we have no idea the trauma he’s endured & we don’t get to tell others how to heal from issues some will never know
[16] maryamimraheal: And the award of the worst father ever goes to…
[17] ariesgirl1963: I don't care if someone smokes a little dope but I do wonder why you feel the need to post it on your social media account.
[18] liz_mo78: You need to grow up and start acting like a father. He’s priority now not your weed and not your friends.
[19] wylelmina: You need to go to rehab like most celebrities I guess...you also need therapy, that's what your friends, your family and your close entourage should push you to do...instead of having you posting your addictions on ig. What on earth your circle is doing letting you go off like that...I'm glad I'm not a celebrity,  you all seem so surrounded by people who don't care about you...
[20] jhoanna_veraah: Las drogas nunca dejan nada bueno.
[21] gcristimara: Ue. Nera ele que virou crente??
[22] cha__fernandez: @haileybieber dude your man is addicted do something before it’s too late
[23] __larakemilyy: Hailey mulher, bote moral nisso
[24] crisylopez: Ay Justino
[25] mariopig: Q si bro, que fumas
[26] simon.mindflip: I think Justin might be preparing a rap album !
[27] jamiemae74: "If the Son sets you free, you'll be free indeed" (John 8:36).
[28] shutupbreezy: Lmao the comments are wild. Justin is GROWN lmao. What in the world y’all. ITS WEED get a damn grip
[29] spfxmaria: I wanna smoke with him @ashleydominiquelane
[30] california4ever28: 
[31] glasspass: If u need one lmk
[32] scatterowl313: Weed isn’t a hard drug for those of you that need to hear it. And honestly, it can be extremely mentally helpful. Not saying it can’t also be hindering too.
But let this dude live his life… it’s not yours.
[33] el_wizza_: Cop your sovs before biebs picks one uo and the prices skyrocket
[34] petermuller5744: The next junkie in town - and when he's gone, nobody cares. Unproductive, showman...
[35] psychic.renegade.tarot: Bong rips are the closest thing to a dab high. Bro is baked out of his mind… which is fine I love weed. But if you gotta smoke like this bro you’re running from your reality.
[36] ztaurosa: these comments are fucking retarded. u guys are acting like sherlock holmes. leave the dude alone lmao get a life
[37] soledadbarreiro: Misión: defender a Justin
Obstáculo: Justin
[38] kemmaben: Dude, cmon. PLEASE get some help. We don’t want to loose you. But more importantly, YOUR SON doesn’t deserve this. He deserves his father, his DAD, to be a damn Dad, bro! This ain’t it.
[39] rbccmsn: These people commenting are wild. Like, are parents allowed to have a couple drinks? Maybe even post a bottle of wine or a fun summer cocktail they’re enjoying? Same fucking thing. Y’all need to chill out and stop inferring he’s a bad dad for letting loose once in a while.
[40] lbell2176: Alot of Christians smoke. Leave the poor guy alone for awhile.
[41] bobbiplows: Oh give over , alcohol is a lot more damaging , same as all these drugs prescribed by doctors, cannabis is a plant with a lot of medicinal purposes !!! Wake up!!!
[42] queenzax: This comment section sucks......
[43] mummashezcooks: Boy needs help for god sake.  He will end up like Liam Payne. Leaving a baby behind.
[44] morrison.janice: And having a beer is ok right ! Grow up people pot is legal in Canada 🇨🇦. Just like a beer is . Not going to give your kid a beer . Why would anyone think he would smoke around kid . That’s why he is by himself !
[45] cosy_cat_illustration: Do you know what was bad for me as a child? Seeing my father drunk. His loss of control. You need help! Your child needs you. Whatever is driving you to this self-destruction, you have to fight against it. You are a father now, you have responsibilities.
[46] mirandaraeallday: Get out of here weed haters he’s one of us
[47] murphrob: Holy cow!!! Y'all need to chill the f*ck, mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down!. It's weed! It's less dangerous than alcohol but if he was drinking no one would say a damn thing! So many people still believing all the over hyped weed propaganda from Nixon is absolutely insane. Y'all really gotta use your brains more than that.
[48] xxangelinaminichilli: Dads drink damn beer with their kids all day and play with their kids and yall praise them . Yall act like this is some crack .
[49] christaroo: Apparently fatherhood has triggered some deeply emotional wounds that you’re seemingly trying to numb. Your son deserves you at your best. These are times you’ll never get back and you’re spending it high. Very sad.
[50] siejmo: People hating on him as if half the population doesn’t smoke pot. It’s legal in so many states and I really don’t see how this is a big deal.
[51] truthonthebayou: Personally I'm not a fan of weed for myself.. however I'm not ignorant either. It is a God given plant that grows naturally and heals people.✨️ He is healing from quite a lot ! Let him be.
[52] moreninha_min: Your pothead will take care of your son
[53] katie657607: Smoking weed is fine but flexing your bong all over IG when you have a kid is craaazzy
[54] caitlynsurdel: Why is everyone acting like he’s smoking around his son? Do you see his son in any of the pictures? Because I don’t. He’s a grown fucking man, let him smoke weed if he fucking wants to like tf
[55] fairyganjamotha: Y'all think this is any different than a picture of someone holding a beer can? Wake TF up. He's fine.
[56] yeoitsjoe: Biebs with the Illy
[57] boro.kevo: get this guy a proper @sovereigntyglass smfh
[58] sk8ratfgt: you can take man out of ontario, but you can’t take the ontario out of the man
[59] shellyavishag: Im suree u dont want to make sweet beautiful little jack blues an orphand god forbid!!!! If u god forbid die from ur addiction he wont even remember u, cause hes so tiny, n peoples memories start at list at three years old, but he willl see one day when he grows up his dads self distruction on social media n everywhere. What kind of person will he grow up to be if this happens, god forbid??? Do u really want him to grow up with his terrible mother, to grow up to have herr qualities n be like her?? I dont think so. I also dont think u want to die, i just think ure confused n tired n need to talk to someone n to get some help. I think about u more than once a day, which is rare for me, thatt means ure like my family, n nott a stranger, n i also pray for u quite a lot, which is also pretty unusual for me. But uu have to helpp the prayers, n helpp god, n help urselff!!!! U have to do something before its too late!!!! No drug addict grows old n lives long, unfortunately justin. U NEED TO WAKEE THEE HELLL UPP!!!! u have a kid now, u cant afford being iresponsible anymore!!!! ALL MY LOVE ❤️ (LOVE)
[60] blue3yebbyphotography: @haileybieber what the fuck was he on yo
[61] vendredi.13: Stop copying me
[62] shellyavishag: Dont u think maybe jesus sent mee n the other people who tell u to quit n go to rehab cause he wants u to do it? God works in mysterious ways honey, dont forget that!!!!!! Ii believe in jesus, just not in the way youu doo. I believe hes an angel n he watches over me with the rest of the angels, the dead riechous people. Like my grandparents n the dead people in my family who were richous, n all the richous people from the jewish bible (old testament) n all the richous people in history who r now dead, theyre all my angels, watching over me alwayss!!!!!! Also all the dead animals in the world r my angels, n my cat children who passed away r also my angels. So listen to jesus, ur god, cause he sent me to u, n he doesnt do things for nothing. U need to hurry up there kid, u dont have all the time in the world, u r in amidiatee dangerr, n each moment that passes its more like that. U can always write me on facebook n or instagram, n i promiss to eventually reply, its just that im so very busy all the time, so it might take me a few days or so. ALL MY LOVE FOREVER N EVER N EVER!!!!!!! IM HERE FOR U, TO LISTEN TO U N TALK TO U, IF URE LONELY LOVE. GOOD NIGHT ❤️!!!

[566] dunhammelendez2005: Wish people would pray and not be so negative ....clearly the guy was draggd all over every social media platform due to child hood trama. Let the kid sorts out his life everyone sitting they trying to say hes using substances. What because he did before? Do you got prof? Or just stirring a pot adding to his plate. Thi os great reason why hes shutting his circle smaller and the world hasnt seen his child i dont blame him one bit. Its sad that people work hard change there life for the better yet he smokes some legal weed and now hes a drug addict. Ok sit back ask urself this ..... Did ur parents smoke? im sure they tried. Better yet ur grandparents you know they did hello every hippie did . I guess that would make everyones family be addicts ,users whatever you want to say . Now if u see a picture with him and his kid and him smoking then i guess if u want to judge then... but until then  what he does on his personal time  leave him alone. Hes a new dad new husband someones son ,father,brother,nephew. Let him live dang INTERNENT BULLIES PERIOD.

[571] teokbreed: arrancalo
[572] xxchelle01: I think it’s telling that a lot of these comments are ridiculing Justin just to forget what’s been going on the past few months.. did we all forget he was around diddy for YEARS as a child & we are just NOW finding out what happened. It’s possible it could stem from that. Yes, finding help should be a priority, but shaming someone into getting help, won’t work. We also have to empathize that we have no idea the trauma he’s endured & we don’t get to tell others how to heal from issues some will never know

[616] adelina.saldana: I thought you were about Jesus? What the heck happened ur a dad now bro
[617] little.miss.paintbrush: Bro..@justinbieber isnt your body meant to be a temple for the Holy Spirit. God says not to defile it. Smoking weed is a demonic doorway and u wonder why yr not well.

[648] livingonplanetclown: Stop hating him for smoking weed damn, everybody did it at one point and if he needs that to cope, why don't you just let him. Sometimes, this is all that helps.
[649] ragnoproduction: I find it funny everybody hating when the reality is that lots of kids from very proper families grow up to be addicts. Sometimes being super strict and not honest will set your child up for failure. The forbiden fruit tastes the sweetest. Did you think you want be an alcoholic when your parents were drunk? No. And dont come telling me weed is a gateway drug and alcohol isnt when alcohol for me is a much bigger enabler for things.

JB never said or did anything to hurt anyone, if anything we should all be supporting him after everything we have found out from his past. yall need to grow up.
[766] kaushal145: You're in a phase of seeking short-term thrills. Your mind is craving validation and acceptance from others. Whoever got you into substances is clearly struggling with their own demons. But you're not like that, you have a great life. Stop searching for problems and focus on the positives. Take a trip with family, enjoy good food, and take some time off.

[822] mtn_mh92: I respect this man now more than I ever did. You deserve it man. Don’t listen to them we’re all flawed I wish they too would see that. That’s why he became a Christian in the first place because we try our best to be good people but still know the flesh is weak. I’d smoke and go for a cruise too if I was him and if anyone cared about his wellbeing they would know why he does this. Oh right cause drinking is socially acceptable that’s so much better for your mental health. (NOT) Get a grip people.

As children, we don’t want to worry about our parents habits… we don’t want to normalize becoming caretakers to addicts as we enter young adulthood due to what we have experienced.  Break the cycles, be present and find joy in the beauty of nature and connections… you don’t need to be high to be ok.  There are so many other ways to be happy.  Legal doesn’t mean it is good for you… it just means someone wants to profit off of you.

[1079] the_one_who_loves_you_38: Hey. You are allowed to struggle. You are allowed to go through something. You are allowed to recover. You are allowed to be sometimes overwhelmed by the uniqueness of your situation, your whole life. You are allowed to be human. You are allowed to be whomever you want to be. You are allowed to take a breather. You have been a role model and will be again. You are special and you are ordinary, we all are. This is rough to see for most and I appreciate the internet expressing themselves. They all want to help. I hope they will. I hope we will. I wish we could take all burden off of you. I wish you get to celebrate who you are deeply, for yourself. I wish that for all humans. You are finding a path to clarity and strength. You can do this, I know it. We are sending love, I hope we are learning to send pure unconditional love to all that we see. We can do it! ♥️

[1296] gggg92660: You are already thirty-one years old! Why are you so weak in willpower? Why haven't you changed your bad habits?? You are getting thinner, uglier, and older now. You have lost the charm and spiritual strength of a normal person. You are a negative male singer. Over the years, you have frequently smoked marijuana and drugs. You are getting thinner and uglier!! I hope you completely quit marijuana, smoking, drugs, and other stimulants!! You must stay away from and cut off contact with drug users, marijuana and stimulant users! Otherwise, you will really die young!! If your son loses his father, he will be very pitiful, sad, and miserable!! You must always remember to quit unhealthy and bad habits! You must eat more meat and sleep more~Quitting drugs, marijuana, bad habits, and bad habits is a normal behavior for a man, husband, or father! You should prioritize your health! Otherwise, as a father, Bieber will have a very negative impact on your child, even a devastating impact! Also, if you persist in these bad habits, they will only exacerbate your death!!!

[1385] clarament.35: It’s just weed. HOWEVER, chronic use of weed keeps you depressed and not present. The daily cheap dopamine release comes with a price. Cheer up, Justin! We’re rooting for you

[1387] _alexcuenca06: La miseria en la que va a crecer su hijo es inimaginable
[1388] nix.vans: Guys the Christian thing was a publicity stunt. It’s the oldest trick in the book. Matthew 19:23, where Jesus says, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven" and further compares it to "a camel going through the eye of a needle. If people have this much money, they think they don’t need Yeshua. Live a lifetime doing as you please and miss out on eternity in the absolute best place.

[1452] tinkgirl25: Please don’t do that around a child.
[1453] kimh212: I know plenty of people who smoke weed, and they all look as stupid as you do.  However, the difference is that you are someone young people look up to.  If you don't want that responsibility, you should get out of the public eye.  Because it comes with the job.  I remember your interviews from your early years.  You embraced fans and took it more seriously as a kid than you do as a man.  Pretty sad.  But even if you smoke you don't have to post something like this.  It's a pretty bad decision professionally.

[1535] luv_bug191: Whoah, hold up there all you judgemental assholes. Take a moment and be quiet. Have any of you been assaulted? If so, was that aired in a way for the whole world to see, comment on and judge you for? We’ve all heard the rumblings that diddy hurt this innocent human being. Do you understand the mental toll it takes on a human when you’re violated? I was fine for years until I wasn’t. It always catches up to you. Unfortunately for him, this entire situation is in the public’s eye. Anyone else notice this behaviour started after things with diddy started coming to light? How do we know this isn’t his current coping mechanism until he finds the right way to deal with it. Maybe this is the only thing that keeps him alive every day. Stop pushing him down and telling him to “be a dad”. Maybe this is the only way he can survive long enough to be one in the long run. We don’t know the situation and until he opens his mouth, it’s best we not judge and just support. Youre not alone JB. There’s a bunch of us surviving out here. Do what you need to do to get to the next day dude. One step at a time. You got this
[1536] saramartin4700: Rock the F* on Justin! You are a rockstar, one who’s went through hell and back. You’re still on top of the world, beautiful wife, a baby AND a kick ass career. Pot? What’s the F*ing deal? Dude, seriously! Do what you can to try to relax, being everything that you are must be exhausting. Carry on, weed isn’t the enemy, it helps keep me sane.

[1545] oliveiradeborapatricia: E justin. Sou sua fã desde quando você começou. Mas sua postura está ridículo.  Hoje você é pai. Tem família. Deveria ser exemplo de pai.
[1546] triplesea333: Jesus loves you bro, keep chasing him and he will keep leading you. Don’t listen to the hate. I smoked for a long time while seeking God before one day I was super convicted ab it and stopped. He wants your heart not perfection once he has your heart he will start to work on everything else. Also those hating should stop considering the dust in their brother’s eye when they have yet to consider the log in their own. There is only one judge, we are to love.

[1588] aussiesue007: Justin your an individual with a special gift & so many people that love you! Why do you focus on the small percent that are  negative? And why hook into the typical fame bullshit? thats made you soo sick before? arnt you an individual?  Why fall for the same mind set of excess & Fame? Its all Bullshit design to loose your courage & you to Think your the Gift and its soo hard. And relying on substances is normal because everyone is telling you so but in the real world people keep thier feet on the ground and dont think excess doesnt have a cost. Your already been thru the shakes & couldnt even dance or move properly why do this? People are saying its only weed but even the legal drugs you were abusing left you in a bad state! And weed makes you loose your motivation. And so just stop and think about anyone but yourself and realise there are always people worse off than yourself! because if you dont your going to loose the people you love or worse like the rest who believed the lie of excess so on and so forth! Amy Winehouse, Elvis, Janice Joplin, Bon Scott I met his parents when he wasnt big and did a show at the Perth Show Ground Western Australia. You went to a Skate Park around the corner from me when you were in Perth for a concert. But my point is Bon Scotts parents were so proud of him and he died alone drowned in his own vomit because of the lie that excessive behaviour is part of Rock & Roll but so many have lost their lives from believing that and when the rest of us dont because we live like that.  And it doesnt take expensive therapy you can use the 12 step program that help with any addiction. Carol Burnett went to AA and was able to work the program and not loose every thing dear to here. Your seen homeless people they have nothing some not thru anything they have done others by addiction. Some hold it together but thats not a guarantee & you dont know till its a problem. Anyways your risking your health! at the very least and you already know how scary that was!

[1623] getusedtoit99: Is this behavior you want everyone to listen to? I’d much rather see a healthy young man with an incredible opportunity to carry his music career to fruition and being involved with his family, than see some dumb punk smokin weed and fu**ing around wasting the rest of his life. Partner with people that can help you truly help you manage public life and figure who you really are.  The idgaf attitude and the image you are putting out there is reckless. Get your head right.

[2265] marcela_ri: Noia preferido
[2266] evelynes_diaries: @justinbieber As a Christian myself this saddens me very much. Justin claims to be Christian but he clearly is not. Why? Because he doesn’t value to portray to be a worthy Christ ambassador. He influence baby Christians like himself to claim to love God but still love the sinful lifestyle of this world. I am not saying Christians are perfect people but we pick up our cross daily by dying to the wicked ways of this world daily. That is the small price every ‘good’ Christian should pay as a grateful compensation (that we cannot pay) for what Jesus done on the cross for us. And if Justin happens to see this I just hope God gives him the will to really cast his cares upon Him and for heavenly peace that this world cannot comprehend. I pray he seeks the Lord like how human seek money and diamonds. That he gets filled by the Holy Spirit.
[2267] kevinricky_96: FUMAAA NERVISOOOOO

Every drop of sweat is a step toward an even stronger and more powerful version of yourself. Your body is the temple that holds your art, your passion, and your dreams. Fueling it well, moving it with intensity, and giving it the respect it deserves won’t just make you feel incredible—it will elevate every aspect of your life.

The discipline that took you to the top of the music world is the same one that will make you unstoppable in any challenge. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about being consistent. Day by day, victory by victory. Every workout is an act of self-love, every healthy meal is fuel for your greatness.

So put on those sneakers, turn up the music, feel the energy flow, and go conquer your health with the same passion you conquer stages. Because when you take care of yourself, the world doesn’t just hear you… it feels you—unstoppable!

[2418] thon_wang_: Bruh why ! Why going back to the old you
[2419] warrior.luna96: Anyone in the comments saying he needs to grow up, needs to grow up themselves! CANNABIS IS LEGAL, AND BETTER THAN DRINKING!! Ya, he's a dad, do you know how hard it is, maybe just think about what he's going through before slamming him....and I'm not that big of a fan of his....but I will defend someone smoking pot....like grow up people and leave him alone, you got nothing nice to say  don't say anything at all....aka, keep your mouths shut
[2420] molly.717171: Feel sorry for Jack that his fathers priorities are getting high and spending all his time with his loser friends. Never with Jack. Never alone with Jack. Not involved in parenting him or being an active hands on father. No one cares you smoke. Doesn't make you look cool. Just like a deadbeat parent.

[2450] _8lavating_minds23_: Who ever is with you now while you get high and post all this on social media is not your friend. These types of friends may seem like friends but they're not. Please consider the path you are heading down is all ro familiar and it's tike for you to make changes for the better not repeating old patterns. Learn the lessons. Do not be the one to put Yourself in a bad situation. Take time. Heal and be with family and be present dor your child. Time will pass and you cannot get that tike back with your family. I hope you and Hailey get some help and step out of the public eye and media to save yourselves and break cycles for your son. God bless. AMEN. UNFOLLOWING. I can't watch you do this to yourself.

[2458] dchance01: I can't believe people it's okay to take Xanax but it's not okay to smoke medical marijuana instead of taking Xanax . I don't think he should have posted it for everyone to see but if he was getting drunk nobody would say anything alcohol is 10 times worse than marijuana

[2476] your_unorthadox_paradox: Yall stop acting like half of yall commenting on here against him smoking don’t smoke and have children. Some of yall probably do it in front of your kids. At least he’s not in front of his child doing it. Yall are so sensitive over what God himself created for healing .  He probably feels better on it than being given medication from a doctor. When god literally gave us all the medicine we need thru nature! So if ya don’t like what you see keep scrolling. No need to judge. Ain’t that Gods job ? Not a single one of yalls. So move on. #clockIt

[2509] airenbrook: Not a good look for a new dad!
[2510] da3ri6di9: He's been through  a lot of  bad  really dark, things.  Its typical for post traumatic behavior : ppl easily get addicted to things that calming their  mind & nervouisity & pain & bad / sad thoughts.  But it's also dangerous  cuz  at one point it won't work anymore so he might want to try something harder
[2511] elsieandalfie: He needs to grow the f'k up. He has a child now! How annoying can a person be!

[2529] rafaelapereiraig: Retrato de uma pessoa infeliz e sem real propósito de vida ou esperança… é isso que significa quando alguém precisa recorrer as drogas… suprir (somente) as necessidades financeiras exageradamente não traz felicidade, mas nem todo mundo está disposto a acreditar nisso.

[2536] imarturoguitar: Andaleeee
[2537] brandon_christopher00: Contradiction, controversy, childish. Why do people now a days be so judgmental over another persons life. He is him, you are you, let him be alone. I bet this post was meant to bring joy but instead the comments are sh****g on the post and it’s because he’s famous and doesn’t usually show other pastimes but because he does it’s suddenly bad!? Get out of here, there are plenty of Celebes, that he’s hung out with and know that smoke weed and are famous for it. I don’t see that stopping their career, I don’t see in the comments, “oh the kids, oh our new generation, your fucking that up for them.” But boy oh boy post something abnormal outside the zone and it’s sending red flags!?? Justin is old enough like a legal adult, it’s probably legal where he’s at, and I see no kid. All of these comments are bloated info that gets dragged into all of this. His fame shouldn’t stop or look bad because of something small. I’d understand if he did rock or something and posted it, but if you don’t like cannabis, I’m sorry your singer likes to smoke, big shock get over it. Niches are niches he likes one thing you like another, we’re not all going to like the same thing.

[2653] heather_hollywood_: Y’all do realize that a solid 90% of the people he’s around do blow! who the fuck cares if he smokes he could get drunk and start yelling and screaming. And to everyone mentioning him being a father now, how many fathers around the world are abusive drunks yelling and screaming at their families scaring their own children, how celebrities are secretly alcoholics and/or using hard drugs and then yelling and screaming at their spouses behind closed doors. He’s a father he’s a celebrity and yes to some he may be a role model. would you rather him be an abusive yelling screaming drunk father! or a  father that’s happy hungry or sleepy, those are the side effects of smoking weed. A lot of y’all have a lot of growing up to do.

O cara tá fumando cannabis, uma planta natural, legalizada no país onde o cara mora. Lembrando que cigarro é 20x pior, e não vejo ninguém criticando quem fuma, enfim a hipocrisia pura. Enquanto o cigarro mata milhões de pessoas por anos, nunca vi ninguém morrer usando cannabis, que coisa né?

He’s being responsible and safe. He’s not a kid anymore, you guys treat him like he’s a baby or your boyfriend. He can make his own choices and they shouldn’t be concerning if they are responsible choices

[3277] lisaannamarierasich: Justin needs to still smarten up in my opinion, and taking a toke / rip from the bong isn’t good cuz that still clings onto his clothing and can still effect baby jack.
[3278] cronk.emily: Wow I sure wish everyone would shut their traps and let him be. No wonder he doesn’t want to post. Everyone picks him apart when he does. He shouldn’t only be able to post if it looks the way you want it to look.
[3279] alexandrama.18: Christ it’s just weed people. I feel like yall need to be the ones smoking maybe you wouldn’t be so uptight. Weed doesn’t make you a bad parent.
[3280] _blacklevi_: Still Wiz
[3281] jasssmin___: Justinn
[3282] heluv.sb: Yall he is CANADIAN AND LIVES IN CANADA. Weed is LEGAL AND IS USED FOR PLENTY OF HEALTH RELATED THIGS. Yall dont know if he is in chronic pain, or going through a problem in his life right now where smoking weed benefits him more. Also, yall realize influencers and celebrities only let you see what they want yiu to see. He clearly just doesnt care whatbtall see anymore and hes been smoking him whole life. Everyone knows this. Most celebrities smoke weed. Its not even that bad. Yall are sheltered and sensitive

[3773] gordibetch: Icon
[3774] joshuaxtjung: bro please stop that thing
[3775] cassiejjones82: I’ve been really nice with my comments about drugs before. But, grow up in and clean up!!! You have a son now. You’re not a kid anymore, you have a kid. You appear on drugs a lot. Your “friends” appear on drugs.  It wouldn’t take much for your wife to gain custody just based on your post if you two spilt.
[3776] s3xi_mam1: Everyone is so quick to judge or say something about him smoking weed the last time I checked he a grown man, and I don't think you all remember he has Lyme disease you can't get rid of that stuff and weed helps the pain. Some of you should try it when your in pain instead of taking Tylenol or ibuprofen, smoke a split and see how much better you feel but it's only for a short term.

[3781] the_valley_of_truth_: YERRRRPPP!!!!
[3782] tmoney_ty420: Most of these comments are exactly why ppl who believe in god still don’t fw any of these religious douchebags or their churches# circles. So quick to condemn someone simply bc they don’t walk your same path. Y’all sittin in here typin up hateful and disrespectful shi to say to someone you don’t know even a fraction of their soul nor know they’re personal struggle and strife yet wanna judge and talk shi as if you do. All you past middle age miserable losers who only seek god just so you can belittle everyone else around you who doesn’t. All these so called religious followers aren’t much different than the ppl who crucified Jesus. I hope god humbles all of you one day and knocks you all off your high horse you decided to prop yourself up on the moment you became a devout follower. Y’all don’t follow god to be better ppl, yall follow him to feel like you’re better than ppl and then wonder why you’re so miserable. Do you Justin. Don’t let none of these lame ass ppl tell you how to live the one life you got.
[3783] inoahman: He just like me
[3784] decenoel: Everyone saying “it’s just weed” right, which is why y’all are so dependent on this drug and need it multiple times a day every day to medicate and numb yourselves. Why is that? There is a dependency whether you want to admit it or not. We all want the best for Justin and Jesus Christ can save him
